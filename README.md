## What for

As you know, Vault provides several mechanisms for auto unsealing. However, sometimes I couldn't use AWS or GCP as the cloud provider. The main idea was to use Kubernetes secrets as the source for auto unsealing.

## Tested on

| Engine     | Version       | Vault mode |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| kind       | v1.29.1       | single/ha  |
| crc        | 2.32.0+54a6f9 | single     |
| OpenShift  | 4.14.8        | single/ha  |
| Kubernetes | v1.29.1       | single/ha  |
|            |               |            |

## Dependencies

- Kubernetes
- Python > 3.7

## How to use

Checkout source code from the repository

Install dependencies  via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Setup system environment

Run script `python app.py`

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VAULT_URL               | Vault server url with port e.g http://127.0.0.1:8200                                                                                            |
| VAULT_SECRET_SHARES     | Specifies the number of shares that should be encrypted by the HSM and stored for auto-unsealing. Currently must be the same as `secret_shares` |
| VAULT_SECRET_THRESHOLD  | Specifies the number of shares required to reconstruct the recovery key. This must be less than or equal to `recovery_shares`.                  |
| NAMESPACE               | Kubernetes namespace for storing vault root key and keys                                                                                        |
| VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN_SECRET | Kubernetes secret name for root token                                                                                                           |
| VAULT_KEYS_SECRET       | Kubernetes secret name for vault key                                                                                                            |

## Deployment

The solution can be run as docker container or inside Kubernetes

Building docker container

```shell
docker build . -t vault-autounseal:latest

```
or build multiarch docker image:

```shell
make docker
```

or You can pull existing image from DockerHub

```shell
docker pull opennix/vault-autounseal
```

### Using helm chart

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

  helm repo add vault-autounseal https://pytoshka.github.io/vault-autounseal

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
vault-autounseal` to see the charts.

To install the vault-autounseal chart:

    helm install vault-autounseal vault-autounseal/vault-autounseal --set=settings.vault_url=http://vault.vault:8200

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete vault-autounseal
